## Description

The [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) is a technique of evolving programs, starting from a population of unfit (usually random) programs, fit for a particular task by applying operations analogous to natural genetic processes to the population of programs. It is essentially a heuristic search technique, i.e. searching for an optimal or at least suitable program among the space of all programs[^1].
